3.9.2:
- New 'mod' attribute for 'block' test so that you can test for modded blocks: 'block': { 'mod': 'rftools' }
- New 'mod' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) test so that you can test for modded blocks
- New 'empty' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests so that you can test for an empty item: 'helditem': { 'empty': true }
- New 'count' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests so that you can add expresssions to test for amounts. For example 'helditem': { 'item': 'minecraft:coal', 'count': '>=10' }
- New 'ore' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests to do ore dictionary tests
- New 'energy' attribute for 'helditem' (and similar) tests to that you can test for forge energy in an item. This supports expressions
